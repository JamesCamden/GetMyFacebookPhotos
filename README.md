GetMyFacebookPhotos
===================

Program to download all of your photos off facebook, including other people's that you're tagged in.

Facebook only allows you to download your own photos, and other existing tools only allow you to download the 400 most recent photos you are tagged in due to a restriction on the Facebook API. This tool goes through all of your photos one by one by parsing the html, downloading them, therefore allowing you to download all of your photos and all of the photos you are tagged in.

Currently the program only downloads all of the photos you are tagged in, however facebook already provides a functionality for you to download all photos YOU have uploaded (https://www.facebook.com/help/www/131112897028467).

Main method is in FBPhotoRetriever
